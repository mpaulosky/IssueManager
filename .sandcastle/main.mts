// Parallel Planner with Review: plan → build → review → pull request loop
//
//   Phase 1 (Plan):   The host reads the open Sandcastle issues with its own gh
//                     auth, keeping only issues and comments from the owner,
//                     members and collaborators, and holds back every issue
//                     that already has an open same-repo PR. A planner agent
//                     picks the ones that can be built in parallel. The host
//                     names each issue's branch (lib/branches.mts).
//   Phase 2 (Build):  For each issue, in its own sandbox (lib/build.mts): the
//                     host merges origin/main into the branch, the implementer
//                     works the issue, the host runs .sandcastle/check.sh, a
//                     reviewer refines the change and returns an approve or
//                     reject verdict, and the host checks again if HEAD moved.
//                     An approved branch's checked commit is pushed and gets
//                     its own draft PR that fixes the issue; anything else
//                     gets a comment on the issue and isn't pushed. All
//                     pipelines run concurrently.
//
// Nothing is merged into main and no issue is closed here: each change reaches
// main through its PR and the checks in docs/PROCESS.md, and the PR's
// "Fixes #n" closes the issue when it merges.
//
// The sandbox gets no GitHub token and no Docker. Agents read the issue from
// their prompt, and every GitHub write (comments, pushes, PRs) is made by the
// host, in code. The host never runs the worktree's git hooks, since agents
// can edit them, so the Docker-backed test suites run in CI.
//
// The loop repeats up to MAX_ITERATIONS times so that newly unblocked issues
// are picked up, and stops early when a round opens no pull request.
//
// Usage (from the repo root, with `gh auth login` done):
//   pnpm run sandcastle
