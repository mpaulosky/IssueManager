## Project Learnings (from init)

### IssueManager Project — Started 2026-02-17

**Tech Stack:**
- Blazor (server-side or WebAssembly, TBD)
- .NET 10.0
- Bootstrap or other CSS framework (TBD)
- API integration with Aragorn's backend

**Blazor patterns to follow:**
- Components are reusable, composable units
- Use cascading parameters for parent-child data flow
- Isolate component logic — keep pages thin
- Async operations for API calls

**UI flows:**
- Issue list: display, sort, filter, search
- Issue detail: read, edit, delete
- Issue create: form with validation
- User feedback: loading states, error messages, success confirmations
