### 2026-02-20: Issue #8 PRD - Proper Branch Workflow

**By:** Aragorn
**What:** Committed xUnit v3 Test Coverage Strategy PRD on proper feature branch `squad/8-prd-test-coverage`
**Why:** Original PRD work was done on `refactor/workflow-consolidation` branch (leftover untracked file); proper Git workflow requires feature branches for each issue

**Implementation:**
1. Synced main branch with origin/main
2. Created feature branch: `squad/8-prd-test-coverage`
3. Committed PRD document (1,134 lines)
4. Pushed to origin with tracking
5. PR created for team review

**Impact:** Clean Git history; PRD work properly tracked against Issue #8; follows team decision to never work directly on main
